# Motorhome-company
Example website of a Motorhome company

It's been a couple of years since I created this site while taking a Web design course. It's responsive and still doesn't have a great design, I'll improve it soon to make it more current and show my design ideas, but you can get an idea of how I do it through the code, it's an example.
